Notes from me:

This is my first solo programming project so please dont be to hard on me for the terrible code. 
I would be happz if someone could take this futher, but at this point i have stopped understanding how and why it works.
But it works atleast on my device so if it doesnt on urs that seems like a U problem.

Have fun :)
